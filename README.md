# Document Similarity
The goal for this project is to calculate the document similarity between several research papers and create a visualization of their similarity. These values can then be used to find the closest documents, which if successful will be semantically similar rather than syntactically. 

Current methods for document similarity all include processing the words in the document to change their representation into that of a vector. The distance between these two vectors is then calculated using one of the many difference equations.

In my first attempt I will be using the Universal Sentence Encoder (research paper found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11175.pdf) to create a fixed dimensional embedding representation of the sentences in the document to be processed. To process the pdfs into text files I will be using PDFminer.six, the version of PDFminer compatible with Python 3. (**note: had to run sed $'s/\r//' -i $(which pdf2txt.py) to fix error in pdf2txt.py file**)

**Requirements:**
 - NLTK 
 - pdfminer.six
 - Tensorflow
 - Tensorflow_Hub
 - Numpy
 - Seaborn (packaged with Numpy)
